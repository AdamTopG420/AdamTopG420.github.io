    <div class="textbox" id="imageText">There's a lot of things to waffle about when it comes to you honey bunches, but here are some of my favourites! Nushka, I never thought I'd be able to find someone as willing to be a silly goose with me! Working together with you to make our halloween costumes (you might have been a tiddle more competent, I won't lie!) was very very cool. Seeing you in your natural habitat, creating and making art (Our costumes were *chef kiss*) was amazing. It's a silly goose eating world but being with you makes it a lil easier and life a lot more fun. We absolutely slayed with the dyed hair too! Being silly (HONEY BUNCHES!!!) with you is such craic. This list isn't in order of favourites but if there had to be a number 1 thing I love about you wifey, it'd have to be your aptitude for 'having the craic'!! You're a really funny, good natured sausage who haas a brilliant sense of humour and makes me laugh!! Your personality of giggles, bounciness, and big smiles is infectuous and I can't not be in good humor around you Nushka!! </div>

            "Honey Bunches, you're genuinely one of the most intelligent people I know. Besides the Leaving Cert DEFINITIVELY proving that (600+ points guys btw) you're also extremely emotionally intelligent. Whenever i ask you for advice on emotional or life things you are brilliant at more than helpful and kind comiserations and/or advice!! You have a balanced method to approaching things which I really admire. You're not afraid to call out people (including me!) for being stupid and you well know how to stand up for yourself! Whenever we have chats on anything serious, like religion, politics, or people, you always have an insightful viewpoint that has often changed my opinions completely on stuff. You have a quick analytical mind and know how to use it!! And paired with your emotional smarts it makes conversations with you mad interesting, really enjoyable and something I look forward to having every single night!! ",
            "This pic is one of the favourites of us together!!! You have a big grin in it that I could look at for hours and we'd just had a very very solid date (all of our dates are tbf) I was in such a state of Nushka Lovin'!! I know i'm making a silly face but we both look really really happy to be spending time with each other. This is kinda a broad one but the third thing I love about you is our time together!! From the chats we have every night to our dates out in art galleries to Total Drama watching to kissing each other. Wifey, whenever I'm with you, time just goes by too fast. I've never wanted to stop hanging out with you, like ever. Nushka time is one of the things that keep me going through the day or week! I can't believe I've only known you for a year Nushkazoid! It's been such a blast of a time, but it's a little odd. How come spending time with you makes it fly by but it feels like I've known and loved you for so much longer?? ",
            "ROBIN!!!! She is *literally* your baby waby!! But for real, the way you love, care and mind your lil homie is really sweet. I wanted to find a proper picture for the 4th thing I love about you which is 'Your passion' and I think Robin has to be the symbol for it!! When you put your mind to doing something wifey, you do it!! Your passion for learning is an obvious one but your passion for helping your mates, art, and life is so admirable!! Pet, with your brain, work ethic and passion I genuinely believe you could do anything in the world and excel at it! If you were a fruit, you'd be a passionate fruit (please laugh) Also unrelated but WOAHHH DO YOU LOOK STUNNING IN BLUE!!! Ocean blue dresses or through ocean blue eyes you're always beautiful wifeyklop :) ",
            "OMG NUSHKA LAUGHS. WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH BUT HEARING YOUR LAUGH IS SUCH A NICE FEELING. aAHHHHH nushka, I don't think i can express it properly but hearing your giggles, chuckles and belly laughs is a wonderful feeling. You have a really contagious laugh and I'm such an omega fan. I know you said when you were younger you used to get the piss taken for it but it actually pains me to think you don't realise how beautiful you and your laugh are. Wifey hearing a new Nushka giggle is always a treat to the ears and it's so like collecting Pokemon!! I can only hope I can keep collecting my pokedex(nushkaDex?) of laughs for a long long time more!! I sometimes wish you were me so you could see yourself the way I see you. Maybe it's rose tinted glasses, maybe you are actually the prettiest, smartest, funniest, brilliantest girl in the world, but the world would be a sadder place without your laugh. I love it so so much that I can't get it out right. I'm looking forward to hearing you for many many more years <3",
            "Devastated and crying that I couldn't find a disgusted Anushka face picture but Wifey!!! This may be an odd one but your expressions are so silly and funny sometimes. I can usually tell exactly what you're thinking or feeling from your face alone. Disgusted Anushka face as you know always make me cackle but seeing sappy Nushka eyes is enough to make my heart melt. You're so not passing the cutie patootie challenge anytime soon btw. Seeing you look at me with love and affection, and being able to see it clearly is stupidly heartwarming. You're an expressive sausage and it's really endearing. The many faces of Nushka are such a slay and I could look at you for days without ever getting tired of looking at your beautiful and expressive face.",
            "Nushka, you're my first everything. You're my first girlfriend, my first kiss, and my first love. I can't believe I get to be in a reality where I can actually hug, kiss and adore my crush!? I'm a lucky lucky guy. Being physcially close to you, feeling you next to me, kissing you and feeling the lil tingles that happen to my lip afterwards, like little aftershocks reminding me of the perfect moments we're pressed together. Feeling the heat of your breath and the taste of your lipbalm it's like every thought I had is replaced by you. You, the wonderful girl in front of me. And all I want to do after we pull apart is do it again. Sometimes it feels like a fantasy. But I am so very grateful it's real.  ",
            "The annual meeting of the anu fan club goes hard. You were absolutely stunning in your dress and with the tiara you are so princess coded!! I'd fallen so hard at this stage (naturally) but I was petrified to meet the homies. It all turned out okay though! It's hard to pinpoint what exactly makes you so special wifey (there's a lot of possibilities tbh) but your empathy and care for others is one of my favourites. You made sure I was okay that night and had a good time and it did mean a lot to me. I think that type of empathy isn't exclusive to me as the wifey either. You care a lot about so many people and do it genuinely. If i wasn't going out with you, I'd very much like to have a friend like you. You're always careful to give people the benefit of the doubt, hype up your friends and sympathise with the least sympathetic people. I think you're one of the sweetest and kindest people I know. Sometimes if someones as sweet as you, I get suspicious it's not their true them (maths teacher rant...) but wifey you're a really genuine person. I feel like you act around me the way you do yourself, like the Anushka I perceive is *the Anushka*. And I'm struggling to put it into words but *the Anushka* is such a brilliant gem of a person. You told me your name meant 'Ray of Light' once and that's so true. Everyone and anyone is lucky to have someone like you in their life. WIlling to care, willing to be kind, willing to comfort. You're a special person nushk, I love you.",
            "NUSHKA SMILE HEHEHEHEH IT GOT ME KICKING AND GIGGLING. Aww Anu, you actually hav+e the most adorable smile it's not even funny. You smile with your whole face like you're being filled with joy and can't help but spread it to the next person with an absolutely radiant beam and a squinty eye twinkle. It so makes me go weak at the knees. I love the way you look when you're happy. I'm typing this out and looking at the picture above this text (if i coded correctly!!) and just looking at the still picture has made me smile each time. It's a warm, welcoming, beautiful thing that makes me swoon SOOOOOOO HARD. The little curve of your smile nushk is gorgeous and I love to see it! It gets me every single time ",
            "I love you Nushka!!! 'HoneyBunches' is the password for the next screen!! The arrow at the top should bring you back and/or search the link again!! I can't wait to see you soon <333. Happy 1 year Anniversary!!",
